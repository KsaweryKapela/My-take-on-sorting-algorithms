# My-take-on-sorting-algorithms
Figuring out sorting algorithms without prior knowledge of their existence.

How do they work?

1. First solution is about getting the highest number and swaping it's place with last number.
Next iteration loops list without it's last item, so on and so on.

2. Second solution compares each number to one on it's right. If it's bigger, then they swap places.
Process is complete if there were no changes made in one for loop iteration.

3. Third solution is about iterating every single integer from the lowest number to the highest.
If item in list matches the integer, it gets placed on specific place.
